\section{\uppercase{RESEARCH PROBLEM}}
\label{sec:objectives}

\noindent Your Extended Abstract will be part of the Doctoral Consortium
digital book, therefore we ask that authors follow the
guidelines explained in this example in order to achieve an
uniform compilation of received contributions.

Be advised that Extended Abstracts in a technically unsuitable
form will be returned for retyping. After returned the manuscript
must be appropriately modified.


\section{\uppercase{OUTLINE OF OBJECTIVES}}

\noindent The use of this document in mandatory for the preparation
of the camera-ready. Please follow the instructions closely in order
to make the volume look as uniform as possible \cite{Moore99}.

Please remember that all the contributions must be in English
and without orthographic errors.

Do not add any text to the headers (do not set running heads) and
footers, not even page numbers, because text will be added electronically.

For a best viewing experience the used font must be Times New
Roman, except on special occasions, such as program code 4.3.7.

\section{\uppercase{STATE OF THE ART}}

\noindent For Doctoral Consortium papers authors are required to have at least the following main sections: (\textbf{RESEARCH PROBLEM, OUTLINE OF OBJECTIVES, STATE OF THE ART, METHODOLOGY, EXPECTED OUTCOME, STAGE OF THE RESEARCH}).
All other sections can be added if needed as well as subsections and subsubsections. References are not mandatory.
\vfill

\section{\uppercase{METHODOLOGY}}

\noindent The paper size must be set to A4 (210x297 mm). The document
margins must be the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Top: 3,3 cm;
    \item Bottom: 4,2 cm;
    \item Left: 2,6 cm;

\subsection{Manuscript Setup}

\noindent The template is composed by a set of 7 files, in the
following 2 groups:\\
\noindent {\bf Group 1.} To format your paper you will need to copy
into your working directory, but NOT edit, the following 4 files:
\begin{verbatim}
  - apalike.bst
  - apalike.sty
  - article.cls
  - scitepress.sty
\end{verbatim}

\noindent {\bf Group 2.} Additionally, you may wish to copy and edit
the following 3 example files:
\begin{verbatim}
  - example.bib
  - example.tex
  - scitepress.eps
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{First Section}

This section must be in one column and is comprised of the
Extended Abstract title, sub-title (Optional) and authors
names and affiliations.


\subsubsection{Title and Subtitle}

Use the command \textit{$\backslash$title} and follow the given structure in "example.tex". The title and subtitle must be with initial letters

In the title or subtitle, words like "is", "or", "then", etc. should not be capitalized unless they are the first word of the subtitle. \textbf{No formulas or special characters of any form or language are} allowed in the title or subtitle.



\subsubsection{Authors and Affiliations}

Use the command \textit{$\backslash$author} and follow the given structure in "example.tex".

Each column must be 7,5-centimeter wide with a column spacing
of 0,8-centimeter.

Example: \textit{$\backslash$begin\{table*\}}

\hspace*{1.5cm}\textit{$\backslash$end\{table*\}}\\

Tables should be centered and should always have a caption
positioned above it. The font size to use is 9-point. No bold or
italic font style should be used.

The final sentence of a caption should end with a period.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This caption has one line so it is
centered.}\label{tab:example1} \centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  Example column 1 & Example column 2 \\
  \hline
  Example text 1 & Example text 2 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{This caption has more than one line so it has to be
